# Sokoban

OOP Game
--------


----------


It is a game called Sokoban and everyone must be familar with it. 
The rule is simple. It is a command-line game. Once you step to some direction, map will refresh and reprint. Maybe it makes you confused, but that can be considered as a sort of retro design.

The class Main is the main class. Using "javac" to compile this program is fine.

There is nothing more to say. Enjoy the game!
